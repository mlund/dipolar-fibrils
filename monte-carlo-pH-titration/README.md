# Titration of a single beta-lactoglobulin

This will place a single protein in a spherical box and perform
pH titration to determine the net-charge and dipole moment.

## Results

PDB id 3BLG, pH 3.7, 5 mM excess salt (required to have a pool of ions in the simulation):

Source    |  dipole
--------- | ----------
Rogers    |  548 D
This work |  403 D

Note that the dipole moment calculations are based on different theories and that they depend
on the choice of origin. We use the mass center, Rogers use the hydrodynamic center.
